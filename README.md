# Gradle Cyclic Dependency Traverse Bug

When recursively traversing the transitive dependencies of a
`ResolvedConfiguration`, Gradle is unable to identify circular dependencies.
This causes Gradle to recurse until overflowing the stack space.

This defect is quite easy to reproduce. Steps shown below.

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ ./gradlew project-1-2-1:die
> Task :project-1-2-1:die FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':project-1-2-1:die'.
> java.lang.StackOverflowError (no error message)

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org

BUILD FAILED in 428ms
1 actionable task: 1 executed
